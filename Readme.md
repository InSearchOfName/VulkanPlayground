# Vulkan Playground

This project is a personal playground for learning **Vulkan** using **C++**.  
It’s my first time coding in C++ *and* working with Vulkan, so the main goal here is exploration, experimentation, and understanding the basics of modern graphics programming.

## Purpose

Vulkan is a powerful but complex graphics API that offers fine-grained control over GPU operations.  
This project serves as a hands-on lab where I’m learning to:

- Set up and initialize Vulkan from scratch.
- Understand the concepts of instances, devices, queues, and swap chains.
- Experiment with command buffers, pipelines, and render passes.
- Gradually build up to rendering simple visual output.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++
- **Graphics API:** Vulkan
- **Build System:** CMake
- **Platform:** Windows
